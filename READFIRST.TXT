CSS Sprite Generator is written and maintained by Ed Eliot & Stuart Colville.

Software Requirements
---------------------

* Apache
* Mod Rewrite (optional)
* PHP 5.2 or above (with Imagick or GD 2)
* Image Magick binary (optional)
* Command line ZIP binary
* OptiPNG (optional)

If Image Magick isn't present the tool falls back to GD 2 (bear in mind output quality won't be as good).

Set Up
------

1. Copy "spritegen" directory to your server.
2. Set up new Apache virtual host and configure document root to point to "htdocs" (preferably other files should not be accessible via the web server).
3. Optionally add mod rewrite rules to Apache virtual host config (see "setup/mod-rewrite-rules.txt" for rules).
4. Additionally you may want to GZIP CSS & JS for improved performance and set far futures expires headers for CSS, JS & images (see "setup/gzip-expires.txt" for rules to add to your Apache virtual host config).
5. Ensure Apache can write to the sub-folders of "cache" (run chmod +w cache/{source-images|sprites|translations}).
6. Copy "includes/conf/example.inc.php" to "includes/conf/live.inc.php" and configure settings according to your server environment.
7. Modify "templates/sidebar.php". It's empty by default.
8. Load in browser and enjoy!
