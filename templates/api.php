   <h1>CSS Sprite Generator API</h1>
   <p>Hello, I can help you generate sprites and CSS rules automatically but you're going to have to supply me with more information. At the very least I need you to post a ZIP file containing some lovely images for me to process. Of course I can be configured with a zillion other options which will help me tailor my output to your liking. Read on for details! Go on, you know you want to.</p>
